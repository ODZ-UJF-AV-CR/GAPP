# This is guide to local development of GAPP

## Preparations

1. You need to use NodeJS version `v22.13.1` or newer or use `nvm use` to switch to the correct version.

2. Since we are using [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/), you need to install corepack:

```bash
npm install -g corepack0.32.0

corepack enable
```

3. Install dependencies by running `pnpm install`

4. Run dependencies by `docker compose up -d`.

5. To develop dashboard, run `pnpm run dashboard:dev`

6. To develop server, run `pnpm run server:dev`
